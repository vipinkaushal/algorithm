# README

I put all my notes for algorithms here.

* Gitbook:&#x20;
* Github Repo:&#x20;

## Remember during interview

* Disambiguate the problem, ask questions, try to understand the inputs and outputs.
* Think about edge cases.
* First talk about the brute force solution, then think about better approaches.
* Think out loud!
